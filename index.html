                <h3>Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi</h3>
                <p>
                    <b>Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi</b> (2 October 1869 – 30 January 1948) was an Indian lawyer, anti-colonial nationalist and political ethicist who employed nonviolent resistance to lead the successful campaign for India's independence from British rule. He inspired movements for civil rights and freedom across the world. The honorific Mahātmā (from Sanskrit 'great-souled, venerable'), first applied to him in South Africa in 1914, is now used throughout the world.

Born and raised in a Hindu family in coastal Gujarat, Gandhi trained in the law at the Inner Temple, London, and was called to the bar at age 22 in June 1891. After two uncertain years in India, where he was unable to start a successful law practice, he moved to South Africa in 1893 to represent an Indian merchant in a lawsuit. He went on to live in South Africa for 21 years. It was here that Gandhi raised a family and first employed nonviolent resistance in a campaign for civil rights. In 1915, aged 45, he returned to India and soon set about organising peasants, farmers, and urban labourers to protest against excessive land-tax and discrimination.

                <h3>Biography</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>In the eyes of millions of his fellow Indians, Gandhi was the Mahatma (“Great Soul”).</li>
                    <li>“Never again” was his promise to himself after each escapade. And he kept his promise. </li>
                    <li>Gandhi took his studies seriously and tried to brush up on his English and Latin by taking the University of London</li>
                    <li>The British victory in the war brought little relief to the Indians in South Africa. </li>
                    <li>“The saint has left our shores,” Smuts wrote to a friend on Gandhi’s departure from South Africa for India, in July 1914, “I hope for ever.”</li>
                    <li>Gandhi decided to leave South Africa in the summer of 1914, just before the outbreak of World War I. </li>
                    <li>In 1934 Gandhi resigned not only as the leader but also as a member of the Congress Party.</li>
                    <li>With the outbreak of World War II, the nationalist struggle in India entered its last crucial phase. </li>
                    <li>In mid-1942 the war against the Axis powers, particularly Japan, was in a critical phase, and the British reacted sharply to the campaign.</li>
                    <li>It was one of the greatest disappointments of Gandhi’s life that Indian freedom was realized without Indian unity. </li>
                    <li>The British attitude toward Gandhi was one of mingled admiration, amusement, bewilderment, suspicion, and resentment.</li>
                </ul>
